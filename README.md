`gitpaths` is a lightweight tool written in Go that retrieves the folder structure of a GitHub repository without needing to clone the entire content.

It's perfect for quickly creating custom wordlists for fuzzing open-source apps or plugins, helping you identify which endpoints in the default repository are accessible.
